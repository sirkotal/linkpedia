* Iteration retrospective: 
  - What went well: teamwork, vertical slice, product vision;
  - What didn't go so well: organization, UI mockups, domain and physical architecture models;
  - What have we learned: basics of Flutter and Dart;
  - What still puzzles us: how to take full advantage of Flutter's features.
