# FIRST ITERATION RETROSPECTIVE

The first iteration was in line with our expectations. We felt that we did better in areas in which we thought the performance would be worse, but had disappointing results in some areas we felt confident about.

## WHAT WENT WELL

- The vertical slice of our application ended up exceeding our expectations; we were very happy with the version we delivered in iteration 0.
- We feel confident the structure of our logical architecture diagram was well conceived.
- Although not perfect, our product vision did a good job in describing the overarching long-term goal of our product.
- We worked well as a team and were able to tackle the challenges through constant communication and teamwork.

## WHAT WENT WRONG

- We overlooked some aspects of the project board organization, due to lack of research on how it should look upon the first iteration delivery.
- We failed to allocate enough resources to the development of the UI mockups.
- Both the domain model and physical architecture diagrams didn't get the attention they should have had.

## WHAT TO DO NEXT

- Improve our knowledge of Flutter and Dart.
- Redesign the physical architecture and domain model diagrams.
- Review the existing user stories and acceptance tests.
- Take a second look at all the things we got right and see if we can improve them even further.
- Continue developing the app so that we can have a better, more complete product when the second iteration delivery comes around.

Despite the issues we faced, we rised to the occasion and were able to deliver our first iteration succesfully; although far from perfect, we feel like we've created a solid basis for upcoming releases.
