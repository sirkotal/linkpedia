## Architecture and Design
The architecture of a software system encompasses the set of key decisions about its overall organization. 

A well written architecture document is brief but reduces the amount of time it takes new programmers to a project to understand the code to feel able to make modifications and enhancements.

To document the architecture requires describing the decomposition of the system in their parts (high-level components) and the key behaviors and collaborations between them. 

In this section you should start by briefly describing the overall components of the project and their interrelations. You should also describe how you solved typical problems you may have encountered, pointing to well-known architectural and design patterns, if applicable.

### Physical architecture

### Vertical prototype
To help on validating all the architectural, design and technological decisions made, we usually implement a vertical prototype, a thin vertical slice of the system.

In this subsection please describe which feature you have implemented, and how, together with a snapshot of the user interface, if applicable.

At this phase, instead of a complete user story, you can simply implement a feature that demonstrates thay you can use the technology, for example, show a screen with the app credits (name and authors).
